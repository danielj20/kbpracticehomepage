        <p>Knowledge Bowl is a trivia competition that started in Colorado and has since then grown to other states including Minnesota, Iowa, and Washington. Knowledge Bowl is similar to quizbowl in that it involves players buzzing in and points being awarded based on correct answers. Knowledge Bowl has much shorter answers than quizbowl, however.</p>

        <p>
          Strength-of-scoring in Knowledge Bowl (or SOS) is a method of rewarding the teams in top rooms by adding up to 1.5 points to their score. Strength-of-scoring is done differently in different states and varies from region to region, but in general, strength-of-scoring works to give the teams in higher rooms an added bonus for the competition that comes with facing up against the other best teams.

        <p>
          As most people who have tried to study for Knowledge Bowl know, it’s hard to find PDFs online of actual Knowledge Bowl questions that have been used in past meets. Even if you do find them, they’ll often be outdated, put on sketchy websites, or you’ll be required to download them just to use them. But there’s an easier way.

        <h4><a href="https://www.kbpractice.com/complete_guide_to_knowledge_bowl_buzzing">The Complete Guide to Knowledge Bowl Buzzing</a></h3>
        <p>
          Buzzing in Knowledge Bowl is a difficult skill to master. Since Knowledge Bowl questions are so short, it can be hard to know exactly when to buzz in. Buzz in too early, and you have almost nothing to work with, but buzz in too late, and the other teams have already taken your point - especially in higher rooms at meets. So, buzzing must be a skill that your team will try to get better at. You may have a designated buzzer, but all of the members of your team need to have some sense when it comes to buzzing.

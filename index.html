    <h3 class="mt-5">What is Knowledge Bowl?</h3>
<p>Knowledge Bowl is an academic quizbowl-like competition that was created in Colorado and is most popular in states like Minnesota and Colorado. Teams of five compete in both written and oral rounds that quiz them about all academic subjects, written to be at a high school level. The questions are provided by Academic Hallmarks in Durango, Colorado. High schools and middle schools all across the U.S. compete at junior varsity and varsity levels, and each year, there are regional meets as well as a state meet, hosted in Minnesota. </p>
<p>A typical Knowledge Bowl question in the oral round might look like this:</p>
<p>In 1792, at Hamilton's encouragement, a bi-metallic standard was adopted in the U.S. This standard was based on what two metals?</p>
<p>Each team is given one buzzer strip. At any time, any player can buzz in for their team, at which point they will have ten seconds to discuss, and their spokesperson must put out an answer. Should the answer be correct (silver and gold), a point is gained. However, if it is incorrect, no point is lost; the reader simply starts over if the question wasn't done or the next team that was buzzed in has ten seconds.</p>
<p>While the formats of Knowledge Bowl are generally the same in the United States, there are some regional differences. Knowledge Bowl usually consists of teams of four to six students who try to answer questions in a written round and in several oral rounds. No team will be eliminated in this event and each team will take part in each round. Knowledge Bowl is usually a power competition in which group teams are reorganized after each round based on their total number of points earned. The written round is a multiple-choice test conducted by each team as a whole. The results of this round were used for sowing teams in oral rounds. Oral rounds include three teams per room and use an electronic locking system. The reader asks questions and the team member can buzz when he makes a decision. If they miss a question, nothing will be taken away from them, but other teams may try to answer the question depending on who buzzed first. The winner is the team with the highest number of points at the end of the meeting.</p>
<h4>History of Knowledge Bowl in Colorado</h4>
<p>Knowledge Bowl began in 1976 as a project within the San Juan Board of Cooperative Services in Durango, Colorado. academic activity involving outstanding students. The first meeting held in Pagosa Springs involved only three high schools. Over the course of two years, it has grown into several meeting invitations in addition to the regional leagues and Colorado State Championships, which have been held each year since then. The first nationwide Colorado State Knowledge Bowl was held in 1978 at Fort Lewis College in Durango. Most of the competing teams that year were from schools in mountain districts. One of the few Front Range schools to compete that year, Green Mountain High School in Jefferson County, won its first national championship. Green Mountain will continue to win three of the first four years of the competition, also leading in 1980 and 1981 in its own state.</p>
<p>From 1983 to 2012, Colorado teams also participated in the Colorado-specific Knowledge Master Open (SME) online competition. The teams answered a set of 200 questions together and scored from 0 to 2000. Each school submitted its own scores and received a summary of how the school performed against another school in Colorado within a few weeks. Colorado SMEs, along with the SME program in general, were terminated after the 2012-2013 academic year. </p>
<p>In Colorado, meetings begin at the writing stage. This round consists of 40 or 60 questions with a choice that the team tries to answer correctly. The team can discuss the issue at the writing stage. Depending on the school, the team may have three to eight people, but only four will attend the writing round. The schools from the written round will determine which teams will compete against each other in the first oral round.</p>
<p>After the written round, the teams will compete in four oral rounds after forty or fifty questions, in which three teams will compete in the hall. As in the writing phase, only four team members can participate in these phases, but the exchange of players can take place after the first half of the questions. The subject is read for the question. Teams can buzz at any time, even before the reader has a question ready. The team does not have to talk about the answer to the question, but can discuss who will answer the question (No speaking time is allowed in the Colorado Springs meeting area. However, teammates may use hand signals). know who will answer). A sheet of paper is allowed to calculate and save the score. If the first buzzing team does not answer the question within 15 seconds or the answer is incorrect and no other team buzzes one of the other two teams, it may ask the reader to end the question and / or repeat the question only once. After each round, the scores are added up and the teams are reorganized and rooms are allocated according to their score. After the last round, the team with the highest score wins the match.</p>
<h4>Knowledge Bowl in Minnesota</h4>
<p>Knowledge Bowl was founded in Minnesota by David Heritage, administrator of Hibbing Public Schools. He wanted to see a bigger challenge when working with unique students in his area. After contacting other schools across the country to find out what they did to challenge their best students, Heritage launched the first Knowledge Bowl competitions in the state. Mr. Heritage for its established contribution to the State Knowledge Bowl with the Heritage Spirit Award. The season featured teams from just eight school districts in western Minnesota. Today, Knowledge Bowl has grown to more than 800 teams across the state and is sponsored by 11 state service teams. </p>
<hr><h3 class="mt-5">Format in Minnesota</h3>
<p>Although there are some differences between regions, most Knowledge Bowl meetings have the same general format. KB's meetings are two rounds, written and oral. The written round (WR) consists of an average of 60 questions with a choice of five possible answers. In the written round, all five team members can contribute for the duration of the round </p>
<p>However, only four team members could take part in the oral rounds (OR). So if the team has five members, one should sit outside with the oral round. The oral rounds consisted of three sets of 15 questions, a total of 45. Some regions played four oral rounds at one meeting, others five. The oral rounds have three teams in the room competing for points. Teams can buzz at any time during the question period. However, they must respond to any information that is provided to them. If one team breaks up before the question is generally read, the reader will re-read the question for the other teams, unless they have eliminated themselves. (The buzzer system is usually set up so that teams can buzz in the style of the Split Second game show, ie the teams are called in the order in which they register on the game computer.) Each team in the round has one designated speaker. The speaker is the only person who can respond within 15 seconds. The spokesman has the opportunity to postpone his answer to another person on his team if he does so for 15 seconds. Some regions randomly assign teams to play with each other during a meeting, while others use "strength ratings". Strength assessment is simply a process in which the three best teams are placed in one room, the other three in another, and so on. Although not all regions use the power assessment method, it was used at Minnesota Service Cooperatives. In 2006, several regions tested the "Strength of Schedule" (SOS) measurement format at Power Ranking meetings, and in 2007 it became the official format. With the SOS, the team gets a bonus of 1.5 points per round spent in room 1, a bonus of 1 point per round in two rooms and a bonus of 0.5 points per round in the third room. SOS points are added to the team's score after all oral rounds. In 2007, SOS became the official Knowledge Bowl method and will be used in the state tournament.</p>
<p>In Marshall County, the writing phase is extended to sub-areas. Each meeting consisted of 3 oral rounds of 45 questions. The four-person limit is also not met until the subarea is met. The SOS system is also in place; but as there was no written phase, no SOS points were awarded for the first phase.</p>
<h4>After the season</h4>
<p>All Minnesota regions use a variety of post-season formats to select teams to represent their region at the state convention. After the basic season, the region organizes a sub-regional tournament. In some regions, teams have to qualify to end up high enough, while in others all regional teams qualify for subregions. After sub-regions, a certain number of teams go to the regions. In some regions the best teams get the bee through the sub-regions directly to the regions, while in others each team has to qualify through the sub-regions. In the regions, the teams compete for the allotted number of state seats in the region.</p>
<p>The 48 teams that qualified for the state were ordered on the basis of enrollment and then divided equally, with the larger 24 in grade AA and the smaller 24 in grade A. All schools from Metro Region (XI) are automatically assigned to grade AA. If a private school qualifies, it will automatically be classified in AA grade regardless of size. If two private schools qualify, the larger will be classified in grade AA and the smaller in grade A. If three private schools qualify, the larger two will be classified in grade AA and the smaller in grade A, etc. The state meeting was held in late April at Cragun's Resort in Brainerd.</p>
<hr><h3 class="mt-5">About Knowledge Bowl Online</h3>
<p>Knowledge Bowl online is the product of almost three months of work in an effort to create an online equivalent to Protobowl for Quizbowl, but for Knowledge Bowl. The question structure of Quizbowl is different from the questions of Knowledge Bowl's in many key ways:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>Quizbowl questions are paragraphs long, and it is expected that you must buzz in during the question. Questions could be 4-6 sentences long. Contrastingly, Knowledge Bowl questions are most often one or two sentences.</li>
<li>Quizbowl questions start hyper-specific and become more and more general until the last sentence, which will probably give it away to anyone who has even heard of the answer at some point in their life. Quizbowl questions are designed to award you based on how obscure your knowledge is. In contrast, Knowledge Bowl questions are usually very direct, and while they may vary in just how obscure or well-known they are, they are usually asking one question, rather than exposing players to tons of facts that might clue them in on what they're looking for.</li>
<li>Quizbowl questions are usually ordering (&ldquo;name this&hellip;&rdquo;) while Knowledge Bowl questions ask (&ldquo;what is&hellip;&rdquo;)</li>
</ol>
<p>To demonstrate this difference, I'll use an example of a random High School quizbowl question, taken from Protobowl:</p>
<p>This author wrote a book in which Dakin is one of a group of fruit pickers caught up in a strike led by Jim Nolan, called In Dubious Battle. In another of this author's works, treasure is sought on Saint Andrew's eve by Joe Portagee and Pilon, who, along with Danny, inhabit Tortilla Flat. Mack and his gang trying to throw a party for Doc in this author's Cannery Row. This author wrote a novel in which Ivy and Sairy Wilson accompany the central family, "Rose of Sharon" breastfeeds a starving man, and the Joad family flees Oklahoma for California. For 10 points, name this author of The Grapes of Wrath.</p>
<p>As you can see, this question begins quite vague, containing a tidbit of information you would have to have memorized in order to get the answer. Now, an average Knowledge Bowl question (taken from my own database of over 10,000 questions):</p>
<p>What is the collective name for relatively thick, wormlike, legless insect larvae?</p>
<p>Neither one is better, but the two are very different. Knowledge Bowl also becomes more about guesswork than black and white knowledge, and many questions may be sorts of puzzles that you have to think about rather than trivia, such as:</p>
<p>The odometer on Bob's Camaro reads 94682. What is the fewest number of miles he must drive before the numbers on his odometer form a palindrome?</p>
<p>This would not be seen in Quizbowl.</p>
<p>After seeing these differences, and not to mention other differences as well (like how much time is allowed after the question is read, or how much time is allowed for the answer to be submitted) I decided to make my own platform. As a kid in his freshmen year at high school, I knew it would be a challenge, but I already had years of web development behind my back and thought it wouldn't be too difficult.</p>
<p>Boy, was I wrong. Making KB Practice online proved to be one of the most difficult programming ventures of my life. I've learned a ton from it, and it was super valuable, but it was difficult, to say the least.</p>
<p>However, now that we're at the end of the tunnel, the end product is an online multiplayer game that anyone can play to hone their Knowledge Bowl skills or just build their general knowledge and learn new things. The UI is fairly intuitive: press Next to go to the next question (only works if the question is done being read), buzz to buzz in, and the answer and answer box function as the place to type your answer and what to press to submit. </p>
<p>It's important to note that in order to most effectively simulate Knowledge Bowl, the answer must be submitted (press the &ldquo;Answer&rdquo; button or hit enter) in order for it to count towards anything. In real Knowledge Bowl, teams can discuss up until the last second, but the spokesperson must turn and address the reader before the buzz time runs out to give the final answer. The reader will not take the last answer they hear said by anyone in the group if the spokesperson does not provide an answer. They will simply ignore it. In a similar, submitting is necessary to finalize your answer on Online Knowledge Bowl Practice.</p>
<hr><h3 class="mt-5">How to Use the Database</h3>
<p>The database on KB Practice contains over 10,000 unique questions and is available to the public not only through playing the online game but also at db.kbpractice.com where it can be searched for any terms or pulled from randomly for practice rounds on the go or official practices. To search for a term, simply type a term into the search bar at the top right of this website and hit &ldquo;Search&rdquo;. To experiment, try &ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo; or &ldquo;Harry Potter&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The database will return all questions with the term (letter for letter - so no typos) somewhere in the subject, question, or answer. This can be used in a variety of different ways. For example, let's say you want to brush up on what a palindrome is and what kinds of Knowledge Bowl questions there are that ask about it. Simply search for palindrome on the online database and you'll get plenty of questions that you can quiz yourself on or read with friends.</p>
<p>Additionally, entire subjects can often be searched for. Searching for &ldquo;music&rdquo; yields most of the questions about music or musicals, because music is usually somewhere in the question (&ldquo;what musical term&rdquo;, &ldquo;what term in music theory&rdquo;... etc.) and searching for grammar will give you most of the grammar questions in the database, as grammar is usually in their subject.</p>
<p>The database is a versatile tool that allows for more focused and precise practice that can strengthen certain weaknesses on your Knowledge Bowl team or individually.</p>
<hr><h3 class="mt-5">How to Use Knowledge Bowl Online</h3>
<p>The user interface of Knowledge Bowl Practice Online practically speaks for itself. Each button says exactly what it does, and hovering over the button will give a sentence long explanation of the role it plays. On desktop or larger displays, the layout is as follows: the question section and input tools on the left, and chat and communication tools on the right. The buzz queue and list of active players are below the question section. </p>
<p>To get started on KB Practice online, simply press the next button. The question section will then begin to read the question, one word at a time. At the end of the question, you'll have ten seconds to buzz in. If you buzz in, you'll get ten seconds to answer, and as far as I know, it's the same in most versions of Knowledge Bowl.</p>
<p>If somebody buzzes in, and you buzz in while they're answering the question, you'll be added to the buzz queue. This means that when they are done answering the question, if they get wrong, you will be instantly buzzed in and have ten seconds to answer. This is the same in real Knowledge Bowl, where buzzer races are important. Luckily, thanks to the live aspect of Knowledge Bowl Online, buzzes are instant, and you will almost never lose buzzer races because of a slow or faulty connection.</p>
<p>Chat features are also implemented on Knowledge Bowl Practice Online. The right side of the screen shows the history of the session, including incorrect, correct, and missed answers, chat messages, and user actions. To change your username, simply type anything into the text input below the chat box, and it will instantly be updated on the server. The text box above can be used to draft and send chat messages as well.</p>

<h3 class="mt-5">How Knowledge Bowl Online was made</h3>
<p>Knowledge Bowl Online is hosted on an Azure server with a professional plan for optimal performance. The backend was made using Node.JS and socket.io. The database was made by web-scraping almost 40 PDFs of past Knowledge Bowl meets. There was only one problem: the PDFs are read line by line, but the actual questions are in even squares.</p>
<p>The way I combatted this was to convert every PDF to an image with Python. There were also headers and footers to each PDF that had to be ignored when parsing the file, so the first step was cropping all of those away such that all that was left was an image that was divided into ten even chunks, each one being a question. Then, still using Python, each image was separated into ten even chunks. Each image now contained one question.</p>
<p>Using the ImageCV library to read the text of the image, extracting what parts of the text were the subject, which were the question, and which were the answer was fairly straightforward: it only involved splitting the text by lines. The first line was always the subject. The last line was always the answer. This meant that by taking away those two, you could always get the rest of the question. The last step was going through each image and splitting the question like so, and then inserting each value into a database. This was the final step that involved Python.</p>
<p>When a new question is requested by the client, no API call is made. The client simply sends a message to the server to get a new question, and the server directly queries the database, running on a shared hosting account that I set up for hobby projects. I may migrate soon, but honestly, I&rsquo;ve seen no use for it yet. Then, once every variable is set properly, the server sets an interval to send out the question and keep adding one word. That&rsquo;s right, it doesn&rsquo;t send out one word at a time. It sends out the entire question up until the last word every time. When testing, this yielded much more consistent results, especially with slow connections.</p>
<p>The UI of KB Practice is made using Bootstrap. I may make my own design system for the site in the future, but it was never intended to look amazing. It&rsquo;s supposed to do its job and look acceptable while doing that, and I&rsquo;d say Bootstrap pretty much does that out of the box with little to no customization. </p>
<p>Points in KB Practice Online are still experimental, and should be expected to sometimes reset randomly. I&rsquo;m still working on storing them in a more permanent manner such that they don&rsquo;t reset every time you change your name. I don&rsquo;t have any intention of storing them in the localStorage like a username would be, however. The goal is to imitate Knowledge Bowl as closely as possible, which means points are gained each session and don&rsquo;t carry over eternally. Every round is a fresh start.</p>
<p>Speaking of ways the site imitates Knowledege Bowl, there&rsquo;s one key way in which it doesn&rsquo;t: rereads. If a player buzzes in in Knowledge Bowl, and they get it wrong, the question restarts. However, in KB Practice Online, I saw no need for this. The text is all still there on the screen, after all, and users can still reread if they want to. So, in a Protobowl like fashion, rather than begin the question anew, the question picks up exactly where it left off.</p>
<p>When Knowledge Bowl Online was first released, it was running on the Free plan on Heroku through an Iframe on my shared server. As expected, it crashed. A lot. There was no getting around it. When I migrated to Azure, these crashes decreased tenfold. But they still happen occasionally. One recurring bug that I&rsquo;ve tried to fix countless times only to see it pop up again (just a little less frequently) is the infamous &ldquo;undefined&rdquo; bug. </p>
<p>Randomly at times during gameplay, the site will break and begin to spam &ldquo;Question is over. Correct answer: undefined&rdquo; in the chat. To combat this without actually solving the problem, I&rsquo;ve added a little failsafe. If the server finds itself either spamming the same answer or sending an undefined answer, it will exit the process. This certainly isn&rsquo;t ideal, but at least it doesn&rsquo;t require me manually entering into Azure and restarting the app. It has to run independently.</p>
<hr><h3 class="mt-5">Knowledge Bowl VS NAQT Quizbowl</h3>
<p>Knowledge Bowl and Quizbowl differ from each other in many key ways, as listed below.It's not just the questions that are different, like I said above, but also the meets, the overall environment, buzzing strategies, and more. It's important for someone coming from quizbowl to understand the differences between the two.</p>
<h4>Questions</h4>
<p>Knowledge Bowl has shorter questions, usually two or three sentences. In the quiz field, the questions are usually longer - in one paragraph - and the instructions are from the most difficult to the simplest (more here). This means that if a player knows more about a certain topic, he can turn to a player with little knowledge. For example, a player who has studied many of Tchaikovsky's works is more likely to be asked a question than someone who has only heard of the opening of 1812. With shorter questions, a more experienced player will always lose in a buzzer race. Another specific part of the quiz field are bonus questions. When the team answers the tossup, they ask three short questions (all related to the same topic), each with 5 seconds. Bonuses usually consist of a light part, a middle part and a heavy part. It is designed to reward teams for the depth of their knowledge.</p>
<h4>Number of Teams</h4>
<p>In Knowledge Bowl, three teams play against each other. Each round contains only two teams in quizbowl.</p>
<h4>Scoring</h4>
<p>Each question yields 1 point in Knowledge Bowl. If the question after the first word is answered correctly, it has a value of 1 point. If someone gets it after all the other teams and misses it, it's still 1 point. When a player answers a power draw (predetermined question mark) in the quizbowl, his team gets 15 points instead of the usual 10. This mechanic rewards players for their depth of knowledge.</p>
<p>For a correct answer tossup deserves a team bonus - three questions for 10 points. This allows the team to earn up to 45 points in the tossup bonus cycle.</p>
<p>Game level</p>
<p>While Knowledge Bowl ends after high school, colleges and universities in the United States and Canada play quizbowl. Many schools in Colorado, such as CU Boulder and UCCS, have quiz teams and participate in regular tournaments.</p>
<hr><h3 class="mt-5">How to gain knowledge (and become better at Knowledge Bowl/Quizbowl)</h3>
<h4>The Goal</h4>
<ul>
<li>Connect and build up as many concepts, or nodes, in your brain as possible</li>
<li>Reinforce these nodes and reinforce the connections between them</li>
<li>Build a deep understanding of concepts and ideas that can be carried on into long term memory</li>
</ul>
<h4>Step One</h4>
<p>Read at least ten pages of an all-purpose book per day. This can be an encyclopedia, a dictionary, the Big Book of Answers, or anything else that covers lots of things in the world. If you want to expand your worldview, aim for encyclopedias or the Big Book of Answers. If you want to expand your lexicon, look for dictionaries.</p>
<h4>Step Two</h4>
<p>Read 50 pages of one of the 1001 Books to Read Before You Die per day. You should finish approximately one a week. Eventually, things will start to go faster and you will be able to go through books that used to be boring if you read frequently enough. When you find out about something in a book that you don't understand or have never heard of, look it up on Wikipedia or Britannica and read the entire article.</p>
<h4>Step Three</h4>
<p>Play Protobowl, Knowledge Bowl Practice Online, or any other trivia game, like Jeopardy Online, whenever you can. Steps one and two are more essential, but playing at high school or college levels will introduce you to all sorts of new concepts and connect nodes in your brain faster than the other two steps can. Any time you run into a phrase you don't know, look it up on Wikipedia or Britannica and read the entire article.</p>
<h4>Step Four</h4>
<p>When you don't know something, and you know someone who does, ask them about it. This will make a concrete experienced memory to go along with the fact. Rather than just reading it, you will remember talking to the person and listening to what they had to say, and any meaningful interactions that came after. These are valuable.</p>
<h4>Step Five</h4>
<p>As frequently as possible, teach others about what you have learned. Not only does this show that you actually know and understand the concept you have learned about, it helps to reinforce whatever you have learned into long term memory. If you find that you can't actually explain what you have learned, reread whatever you read, as well as finding an additional source to reinforce the concept.</p>
<hr><h3 class="mt-5">How to avoid buzzer traps</h3>
<p>Knowledge Bowl, unlike quizbowl, can have questions that involve tricking players into thinking they can anticipate the answer when in actuality, the question swerves in a different direction, like this:</p>
<p>"One man gained fame for starting the Kulturkampf as well as a war with France. Otto van Bismarck lends his name to the capital of which U.S. state?"</p>
<p>It can be difficult to avoid buzzer traps, or speedbumps, especially when the competition is high and the points are neck and neck.</p>
<h4>Listen to the question carefully</h4>
<p>One way to avoid buzzer traps is to listen carefully. It sounds obvious, but you can usually tell when a question is going to go in another direction, especially based on its length. Questions that seem too short are usually buzzer traps that are going in a different direction. Seldom will you get "gimmes" if the questions are written well.</p>
<h4>Stay focused</h4>
<p>As a team, you need to stay focused. If your focus is scattered, you will either buzz in on the wrong question, forget a question, or miss a necessary buzz. By keeping your focus on the question, you are more likely to know if the answer is correct.</p>
<p>In that same vein, staying focused for 15 seconds is much better than focusing for 3 seconds. We are always told to focus on the question, not the buzzer. Also, try not to buzz in just for the heck of it. There are times when you need to buzz in when the buzzer sounds, but in general, as a team, it is best to wait until the buzzer rings. If a team gets too excited, they will miss valuable time trying to remember where their buzzer was.</p>
<h4>Watch for others (be aware of your competition)</h4>
<p>The second way to avoid buzzer traps is to just watch the other team buzz in. Many teams get confused by the buzzer. They sometimes even buzz in before the buzzer sounds. Once you get the hang of how the buzzer works, you will quickly find that the previous buzzer was timed correctly and will be able to buzz in before the next question if the team knows the answer. The important thing is to be able to focus on the question and not the buzzer. This also helps your teammates who are ahead of you.</p>
<h4>Be Prepared</h4>
<p>The third way to avoid buzzer traps is to be prepared. For example, when I was in the 10th grade, my captain was working on one of the teams. He had been preparing by watching a team in particular for a while. Then, when the buzzer went off, it was as if they all forgot that the team that had been preparing before was still working. As a result, they began shooting questions before their opponents were ready.</p>
<p>Another way to avoid buzzer traps is to be aware of the buzzers. For example, if the moderator asks you to tell them the year each state was admitted to the union, do not think "Yea, sure." Instead, think about what the moderator is looking for and answer the question with the best answer.</p>
<hr><h3 class="mt-5">How to distribute academic subjects for Knowledge Bowl</h3>
<p>Once you've picked your team for Knowledge Bowl, it's important not only to make sure that you have good chemistry and work well together in general, but also that you distribute topics and regions of academia across your group. Knowledge Bowl questions span every subject and any topic could be asked about, so it's crucial you'll be able to know as soon as you buzz in whose specialty it is to answer. You also wouldn't want to have all math people on your team, or all literature, because although you would probably nail the math/literature problems, you would have nothing once a geography question came. Balance in teams could arguably even be more important than chemistry, because if the knowledge just isn't there, it isn't possible to get it during the heat of the moment, no matter how well everybody works together.</p>
<p>Of course, there are alternative routes, like having every player on the team build up general knowledge, but the downside of this is that there is much more discussion and debate as many people's knowledge overlap. There may not be a clear answer most of the time when most players have a good idea of the question.</p>
<p>In order to be specific and strategic, I have created a distribution of (nearly) all Knowledge Bowl topics that could be seen in an average tossup, ranging from rare questions to practically every other question:</p>
<ul>
<li>Literature</li>
<li>Space</li>
<li>Technology</li>
<li>Religion</li>
<li>Philosophy</li>
<li>Grammar and usage</li>
<li>Geography</li>
<li>Geology</li>
<li>Wars and conflicts</li>
<li>Political and social movements</li>
<li>Binary</li>
<li>Animal world</li>
<li>Government and politics</li>
<li>The arts (painting, sculpture, etc.)</li>
<li>Landforms</li>
<li>Native American culture</li>
<li>Health and Medicine</li>
<li>The Human Body</li>
<li>Economics</li>
<li>Business</li>
<li>Eras and their highlights</li>
<li>Law</li>
<li>Math, Numbers, Conversions, and Measurements</li>
<li>Physics</li>
<li>Chemistry</li>
<li>Climate and Weather</li>
<li>Botany</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, each team will distribute and order this list differently, and not every item on the list needs to be covered in every successful team, but it's important to understand the scope of each question.</p>
<p>In the written round especially, this tactic of dividing up topics can come in handy. If there are five players on a team (in some states, there are six; in others four; but this still applies) and there are nearly thirty topics, this allows for about six topics per player. Once you have distributed topics according to previous knowledge and who is inclined to learn what, it becomes much easier to tackle the written round than before. Rather than simply passing around the sheets and hoping somebody will have the right answer, it becomes easy to assign certain questions to certain team members and everything can in general go faster.</p>
<p>Another advantage of distributing information in advance is that it enables you to ensure that if you happen to be on a team with, for example, the two greatest students in history, they are both on your team and not his or hers. If the person who would otherwise be sitting next to you (for example, if you are on a math team) happens to come up to compete, that is someone who has a solid knowledge base. You have a lot of really good students on your team who could make your victory quite likely, but this could be compromised if, for example, Socrates is on your team and he knows nothing about engineering, so he doesn't know how to answer questions about the Human Body. While I do not agree with that particular person, I can imagine the difficulties in allowing them on your team if you knew they were otherwise incompetent at answering technical questions. I suppose there are times you just can't win.</p>
<hr><h3 class="mt-5">How to Learn More About a Specific Topic</h3>
<p>If you want to get better at, say, biology, you must get a wide range of sources to draw from and find facts about all parts of biology. Do not fall into the trap of having one basic source for all biology related topics, you must learn and experience all parts of biology. This means spending time reading books from the library, visiting museums, taking online courses and so forth. But how do you know where to start?</p>
<p>We all have our preferred reading list; whether it be Tolkien or Rowling or Goethe, a list of books or a series of articles that we like to read. Unfortunately, as you progress into higher and higher levels, you begin to understand that if you really want to learn more about something, you have to work on getting your own ideas and information from a wide range of sources, not just from your one favorite source.</p>
<h4>Immerse yourself</h4>
<p>The first phase of learning is that you immerse yourself in the domain that you are studying. You immerse yourself in the world of that particular topic and get a very deep understanding of it. You can immerse yourself in a number of ways: you can read books, visit museums, explore YouTube, play a game, try new things and so forth. But, if you are at an early stage in your life-learning career and are struggling with biology, it is often not the book you are using as your means of knowledge acquisition; it's YouTube. The good thing about YouTube is that you can find numerous videos on anything that you are interested in. This can be especially useful for a topic that is relatively new and has a lot of unknowns. If you are able to find videos on YouTube that give you the broad strokes and don't give too much away, you can get a good general idea about the subject and be able to build on that information.</p>
<hr><h3 class="mt-5">How to strategize for Knowledge Bowl</h3>
<p>Knowledge Bowl can be very daunting to prepare for and strategizing is important for befor you enter into a meet. Consider these questions before you and your team begin the meet: how well do we think we can do? What topics do we need to work on? How ambitious should we be with our buzzes? What room do we want to be in after the written round?</p>
<p>These are important questions to be asking about where you want to go and how you want to get there. That way, when a certain member of your team buzzes in, there will be no conflict about how early they should have buzzed in.</p>
<p>Focus on time and attention. We have all heard that people today have a shorter attention span than ever before and this is definitely true. One of the reasons this is so often accepted as fact is because this is the most common factor used in measuring the amount of screen time that people do. This is not really a valid measurement though because, though it may take 10 seconds to check your phone in line at Starbucks, it does not mean that it takes 10 seconds to do a math problem.</p>
<p>The reason why this is important is because when you are taking a timed exam or an interview, your goal is to get to the end as quickly as possible, not to answer as many questions as you can.</p>
<p>We've all heard the common adage: buzz in when you know the question, not the answer. Of course, this holds true. In most instances. If you have decided that you know the answer to the question and want to answer it as quickly as possible, then you have to buzz in even before you know the answer. Not only does this help with getting out in a hurry, but it also gives you the mental edge over the other teams, who will have to spend valuable time searching for the correct answer.</p>
<p>Groups are not just about the number of buzzes that a team makes on their buzzes. The goal of a group in Knowledge Bowl is to have all members learn the subject at least to a high enough level so that, on a given day, at least half of them are going to be able to answer questions. This means that all members need to be learning. For most teams, even the best members do not necessarily have the background or the familiarity with the subject to be able to provide the specific, necessary answers to the questions on that day.</p>
<p>As a group, you should strive to maximize the amount of work that you are putting into Knowledge Bowl. When it comes to being a good team, the way you go about this is not by competing for the highest score, but by doing things strategically so that everyone is successful. The goal is to win the game and not by who can buzz in first.</p>
<p>We've mentioned the need for groups to get out in a hurry, and that is because a lot of teams approach every Knowledge Bowl as a race. The first group to buzz in will usually be able to answer more questions, but that does not mean that they will do better than the rest of the teams. The way to win is not to buzz in quickly, but rather to buzz in correctly, execute the correct buzzes, and follow up with timely follow ups.</p>
<p>A good strategy is to brainstorm how to efficiently approach the round, get as much work done as possible, and use that experience to your advantage. Each team should know what questions they are good at answering, what questions they can write quickly, and what questions they can stall on until they know the answer. Then, they need to pick the best answers and choose to buzz in when they know the question.</p>
<p>A very common mistake that many teams make is to panic when they don't know an answer and then buzz in before they know the question. There are times when you need to buzz in and all of your work will come to fruition. However, a vast majority of the time when you need to buzz in, you should choose to analyze the question first and then buzz in once you have enough information.</p>
<hr><h3 class="mt-5">About State Knowledge Bowl</h3>
<p>The Minnesota State Knowledge Bowl Meet is an annual two-day academic quiz competition organized by the Minnesota Service Cooperatives, the governing body of the Minnesota Knowledge Bowl. The State Meet was held in April at Cragun's Resort in Brainerd.</p>
<h4>Format</h4>
<p>The 48 teams that qualified for the Minnesota State Knowledge Bowl Meet were ranked by enrollment size and then split, with 24 major AA schools and 24 smaller A-class schools. All Metro schools will be automatically placed in AA class . If a private school qualifies, it will automatically be classified in AA grade regardless of size. If two private schools qualify, the larger one will be in grade AA and the smaller one in grade A. If three private schools qualify, the larger two will be in grade AA and the smallest in grade A, etc.</p>
<p>The first day of the State Knowledge Bowl Meet begins with a night of banquets at which all teams present themselves. After the banquet, the written phase consisted of 60 questions. After scoring the written rounds, the teams are ranked. If there is a tie after the written stage, several questions will be used to cancel the tie. The status of the meeting is "power-ranged", meaning that the teams are grouped according to their current position as follows:</p>
<p>Room 1: # 1-2-3</p>
<p>Room 2: # 4-5-6</p>
<p>Room 3: # 7-8-9</p>
<p>Room 4: # 10-11-12</p>
<p>Room 5: # 13-14-15</p>
<p>Room 6: # 16-17-18</p>
<p>Room 7: # 19-20-21</p>
<p>Room 8: # 22-23-24</p>
<p>The teams have a strength rating for five oral rounds with 45 questions. In the end, the team with the highest overall score is the state champion. The top 3 teams will receive the cup and the top 6 teams will receive the medal. If, after the fifth and final oral round, the result is among the top 6, it is divided into 15 "overtime" questions. The Heritage Spirit Award is given to a team in each class that demonstrates a positive attitude and sporting spirit expressed by readers, computer operators, coaches and other teams.</p>
<h4>Historical format</h4>
<p>In 2007, the power of scoring or "POS" began to be used at the state tournament. After the final oral rounds, teams will receive an extra 1.5 points for each round they fight in the upper chamber, an extra 1 point for each round in the second chamber and an extra 0.5 points for each stage in the upper chamber. This is done to help break the connection and recognize that scoring points is more difficult in the upper rooms.</p>
<p>Before the year 2000, there was a "championship round", in which the three best teams competed for who would become the champion. </p>
<p>In addition, the State Meet was divided into two classes until 1996.</p>
<p>Regarding the end of the state tournament in the Brainerd area, former ECSU Knowledge Bowl Coordinator Marilyn McGowan said: to have it there, so it was moved to Cragun's at the last minute. The original plan was to organize it in each ECSU region to take place throughout the state. However, he worked hard to keep him in the resort without city trials, which he has managed to do in Brainerdmarren since the measles outbreak. We are also in Madden's and Breezy Point.</p>
<p>The 1984 tournament now has five oral rounds, but in 1986 and 1987 only four oral rounds were played . In 1991 and earlier, the oral rounds consisted of 60 questions. In 1992, a change was made to 45 questions per round. In 2013, only four oral wheels were used. Due to bad weather in the state, Friday's plan was postponed a few hours to allow for late arrivals; the fifth oral round was canceled due to further adherence to the schedule. This period meant that some schools could never attend. Only 21 AA teams participated instead of the usual 24.</p>

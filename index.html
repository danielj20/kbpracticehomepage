            Knowledge Bowl is an academic quizbowl-like competition that was created in Colorado and is most popular in states like Minnesota and Colorado. Teams of five compete in both written and oral rounds that quiz them about all academic subjects, written to be at a high school level. The questions are provided by Academic Hallmarks in Durango, Colorado. High schools and middle schools all across the U.S. compete at junior varsity and varsity levels, and each year, there are regional meets as well as a state meet, hosted in Minnesota. 
            <br>
            <br>
            A typical Knowledge Bowl question in the oral round might look like this:
            <br>
            <br>
            <q>1792, at Hamilton's encouragement, a bi-metallic standard was adopted in the U.S. This standard was based on what two metals?</q> 
            <br>
            <br>
            Each team is given one buzzer strip. At any time, any player can buzz in for their team, at which point they will have ten seconds to discuss, and their spokesperson must put out an answer. Should the answer be correct (silver and gold), a point is gained. However, if it is incorrect, no point is lost; the reader simply starts over if the question wasn’t done or the next team that was buzzed in has ten seconds.

            Knowledge Bowl online is the product of almost three months of work in an effort to create an online equivalent to Protobowl for Quizbowl, but for Knowledge Bowl. The question structure of Quizbowl is different from the questions of Knowledge Bowl’s in many key ways:
            <ul>
              <li>Quizbowl questions are paragraphs long, and it is expected that you must buzz in during the question. Questions could be 4-6 sentences long. Contrastingly, Knowledge Bowl questions are most often one or two sentences.
              </li>
              <li>
                Quizbowl questions start hyper-specific and become more and more general until the last sentence, which will probably give it away to anyone who has even heard of the answer at some point in their life. Quizbowl questions are designed to award you based on how obscure your knowledge is. In contrast, Knowledge Bowl questions are usually very direct, and while they may vary in just how obscure or well-known they are, they are usually asking one question, rather than exposing players to tons of facts that might clue them in on what they’re looking for.
              </li>
              <li>
                Quizbowl questions are usually ordering (“name this…”) while Knowledge Bowl questions ask (“what is…”)
              </li>
            </ul>
            To demonstrate this difference, I’ll use an example of a random High School quizbowl question, taken from Protobowl:
            <br>
            <br>
            <code>This author wrote a book in which Dakin is one of a group of fruit pickers caught up in a strike led by Jim Nolan, called In Dubious Battle. In another of this author's works, treasure is sought on Saint Andrew's eve by Joe Portagee and Pilon, who, along with Danny, inhabit Tortilla Flat. Mack and his gang trying to throw a party for Doc in this author's Cannery Row. This author wrote a novel in which Ivy and Sairy Wilson accompany the central family, "Rose of Sharon" breastfeeds a starving man, and the Joad family flees Oklahoma for California. For 10 points, name this author of The Grapes of Wrath.</code>
            <br>
            <br>
            As you can see, this question begins quite vague, containing a tidbit of information you would have to have memorized in order to get the answer. Now, an average Knowledge Bowl question (taken from my own database of over 10,000 questions):
            <br>
            <br>
            <q>What is the collective name for relatively thick, wormlike, legless insect larvae?</q>
            <br>
            <br>
            Neither one is better, but the two are very different. Knowledge Bowl also becomes more about guesswork than black and white knowledge, and many questions may be sorts of puzzles that you have to think about rather than trivia, such as:
            <br>
            <br>
            <q>The odometer on Bob's Camaro reads 94682. What is the fewest number of miles he must drive before the numbers on his odometer form a palindrome?</q>
            <br>
            <br>
            This would not be seen in Quizbowl.
            <br>
            <br>
            After seeing these differences, and not to mention other differences as well (like how much time is allowed after the question is read, or how much time is allowed for the answer to be submitted) I decided to make my own platform. As a kid in his freshmen year at high school, I knew it would be a challenge, but I already had years of web development behind my back and thought it wouldn’t be too difficult.
            <br>
            <br>
            Boy, was I wrong. Making KB Practice online proved to be one of the most difficult programming ventures of my life. I’ve learned a ton from it, and it was super valuable, but it was difficult, to say the least.
            <br>
            <br>
            However, now that we’re at the end of the tunnel, the end product is an online multiplayer game that anyone can play to hone their Knowledge Bowl skills or just build their general knowledge and learn new things. The UI is fairly intuitive: press Next to go to the next question (only works if the question is done being read), buzz to buzz in, and the answer and answer box function as the place to type your answer and what to press to submit. 
            <br>
            <br>
            It’s important to note that in order to most effectively simulate Knowledge Bowl, the answer must be submitted (press the “Answer” button or hit enter) in order for it to count towards anything. In real Knowledge Bowl, teams can discuss up until the last second, but the spokesperson must turn and address the reader before the buzz time runs out to give the final answer. The reader will not take the last answer they hear said by anyone in the group if the spokesperson does not provide an answer. They will simply ignore it. In a similar, submitting is necessary to finalize your answer on Online Knowledge Bowl Practice.

            The database on KB Practice contains over 10,000 unique questions and is available to the public not only through playing the online game but also at db.kbpractice.com where it can be searched for any terms or pulled from randomly for practice rounds on the go or official practices. To search for a term, simply type a term into the search bar at the top right of this website and hit “Search”. To experiment, try “Shakespeare” or “Harry Potter”.
            <br>
            <br>
            The database will return all questions with the term (letter for letter - so no typos) somewhere in the subject, question, or answer. This can be used in a variety of different ways. For example, let’s say you want to brush up on what a palindrome is and what kinds of Knowledge Bowl questions there are that ask about it. Simply search for palindrome on the online database and you’ll get plenty of questions that you can quiz yourself on or read with friends.
            <br>
            <br>
            Additionally, entire subjects can often be searched for. Searching for “music” yields most of the questions about music or musicals, because music is usually somewhere in the question (“what musical term”, “what term in music theory”... etc.) and searching for grammar will give you most of the grammar questions in the database, as grammar is usually in their subject.
            <br>
            <br>
            The database is a versatile tool that allows for more focused and precise practice that can strengthen certain weaknesses on your Knowledge Bowl team or individually.

            The user interface of Knowledge Bowl Practice Online practically speaks for itself. Each button says exactly what it does, and hovering over the button will give a sentence long explanation of the role it plays. On desktop or larger displays, the layout is as follows: the question section and input tools on the left, and chat and communication tools on the right. The buzz queue and list of active players are below the question section. 
            <br>
            <br>
            To get started on KB Practice online, simply press the next button. The question section will then begin to read the question, one word at a time. At the end of the question, you’ll have ten seconds to buzz in. If you buzz in, you’ll get ten seconds to answer, and as far as I know, it’s the same in most versions of Knowledge Bowl.
            <br>
            <br>
            If somebody buzzes in, and you buzz in while they’re answering the question, you’ll be added to the buzz queue. This means that when they are done answering the question, if they get wrong, you will be instantly buzzed in and have ten seconds to answer. This is the same in real Knowledge Bowl, where buzzer races are important. Luckily, thanks to the live aspect of Knowledge Bowl Online, buzzes are instant, and you will almost never lose buzzer races because of a slow or faulty connection.
            <br>
            <br>
            Chat features are also implemented on Knowledge Bowl Practice Online. The right side of the screen shows the history of the session, including incorrect, correct, and missed answers, chat messages, and user actions. To change your username, simply type anything into the text input below the chat box, and it will instantly be updated on the server. The text box above can be used to draft and send chat messages as well.

            <h4>The Goal:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Connect and build up as many concepts, or nodes, in your brain as possible
              </li>
              <li>
                Reinforce these nodes and reinforce the connections between them
              </li>
              <li>
                Build a deep understanding of concepts and ideas that can be carried on into long term memory
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Step One</h4>
            Read at least ten pages of an all-purpose book per day. This can be an encyclopedia, a dictionary, the Big Book of Answers, or anything else that covers lots of things in the world. If you want to expand your worldview, aim for encyclopedias or the Big Book of Answers. If you want to expand your lexicon, look for dictionaries.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>Step Two</h4>
            Read 50 pages of one of the 1001 Books to Read Before You Die per day. You should finish approximately one a week. Eventually, things will start to go faster and you will be able to go through books that used to be boring if you read frequently enough. When you find out about something in a book that you don't understand or have never heard of, look it up on Wikipedia or Britannica and read the entire article.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>Step Three</h4>
            Play Knowledge Bowl Online, Protobowl, or any other trivia game, like Jeopardy Online, whenever you can. Any free time should not be taken up by YouTube or Reddit. They are the false-learners. Steps one and two are more essential, but playing at high school or college levels will introduce you to all sorts of new concepts and connect nodes in your brain faster than the other two steps can. Any time you run into a phrase you don't know, look it up on Wikipedia or Britannica and read the entire article.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>Step Four</h4>
            When you don't know something, and you know someone who does, ask them about it. This will make a concrete experienced memory to go along with the fact. Rather than just reading it, you will remember talking to the person and listening to what they had to say, and any meaningful interactions that came after. These are valuable.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>Step Five</h4>
            As frequently as possible, teach others about what you have learned. Not only does this show that you actually know and understand the concept you have learned about, it helps to reinforce whatever you have learned into long term memory. If you find that you can't actually explain what you have learned, reread whatever you read, as well as finding an additional source to reinforce the concept.

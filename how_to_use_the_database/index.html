            How to Use the Knowledge Bowl Online Database
        </h1>
        <h3>
            Accurate Searching
        </h3>
        <p>
            The database on KB Practice contains over 10,000 unique questions and is available to the public not only through playing the online game but also at db.kbpractice.com where it can be searched for any terms or pulled from randomly for practice rounds on the go or official practices. To search for a term, simply type a term into the search bar at the top right of this website and hit “Search”. To experiment, try “Shakespeare” or “Harry Potter”.
        </p>
        <p>
            The database will return all questions with the term (letter for letter - so no typos) somewhere in the subject, question, or answer. This can be used in a variety of different ways. For example, let’s say you want to brush up on what a palindrome is and what kinds of Knowledge Bowl questions there are that ask about it. Simply search for palindrome on the online database and you’ll get plenty of questions that you can quiz yourself on or read with friends.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Searching for Subjects
        </h3>
        <p>
            Additionally, entire subjects can often be searched for. Searching for “music” yields most of the questions about music or musicals, because music is usually somewhere in the question (“what musical term”, “what term in music theory”... etc.) and searching for grammar will give you most of the grammar questions in the database, as grammar is most often in their subject.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Find Weak Links
        </h3>
        <p>
            The database is a versatile tool that allows for more focused and precise practice that can strengthen certain weaknesses on your Knowledge Bowl team or individually. It can become very specific as well. If you specialize in Geography on your team, and you want to learn more about the major straits of the world, simply enter “strait” into the search bar and click “Search”. You will not only learn about the straits of the world, but you will also learn the kind of questions Knowledge Bowl asks about straits, which ones come up most frequently, and what Knowledge Bowl most often asks about straits.

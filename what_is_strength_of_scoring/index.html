            What Is Strength-Of-Scoring In Knowledge Bowl?
        </h1>
        <h3>
            Competitive Advantage
        </h3>
        <p>
            Strength-of-scoring in Knowledge Bowl (or POS) is a method of rewarding the teams in top rooms by adding up to 1.5 points to their score. Strength-of-scoring is done differently in different states and varies from region to region, but in general, strength-of-scoring works to give the teams in higher rooms an added bonus for the competition that comes with facing up against the other best teams.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How It Works
        </h3>
        <p>
            Strength-of-scoring is a system implemented in Knowledge Bowl to give more points to the teams that are doing better in the meet. Strength-of-scoring points are added at the end of the last oral round of Knowledge Bowl. Here’s how they work: for every round a team is in the top room on either a Junior Varsity or Varsity level, they are awarded an added 1.5 points. For every round they are in the second highest room on a Junior Varsity or Varsity level, they are awarded one point, and for every round they are in the third highest room, they are awarded one half point. Once points are awarded accordingly, total points are tallied and awards are given.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Why it Exists
        </h3>
        <p>
            Sometimes, a team in a very low room in Knowledge Bowl could be misplaced due to a fluke round. They could even intentionally do poorly in a round to have less competition and rake in tons of points. Strength-of-scoring works to combat this by making it more desirable to be in the top rooms rather than intentionally diminishing your competition.

        <h3>Knowledge Bowl Information
        </h3>
        <p>Knowledge Bowl is a trivia competition that started in Colorado and has since then grown to other states including Minnesota, Iowa, and Washington. Knowledge Bowl is similar to quizbowl in that it involves players buzzing in and points being awarded based on correct answers. Knowledge Bowl has much shorter answers than quizbowl, however.
        </p>
        <h3>About Knowledge Bowl
        </h3>
        <p>Knowledge Bowl began in the United States in Durango, Colorado. The company that provides the questions for Knowledge Bowl is Academic Hallmarks, based in the same town. Knowledge Bowl meets are hosted at various schools who invite others and usually award teams trophies based on the highest scoring teams.

            Knowledge Bowl teams are usually made of anywhere from 4 to 6 members, and depending on what the rules are in the location you are playing it, a limited number of players may be allowed in each round. Most meets begin with a written round, a multiple choice test that teams take together (talking is allowed) and submit at the end of the round. Then, oral rounds comprise the majority of the time spent at a meet, when teams will compete with their own buzzer strip and buzz in when they know the answer (or, sometimes, the question). One point is awarded to each correct answer, and incorrect answers do not remove points from a team’s total score. At the end of the meet, points are awarded to the teams with the highest amount of points.
            </p>
